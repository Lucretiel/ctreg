# Things we still need

- Attributes for the generated type
  - `cfg` attr
  - docs
  - other arbitrary attributes
- More regex search methods: iteration, anchored search
- Introspection? Unnecessary in principle, but might be nice for eg serializing
- Regex value handling via OnceLock or something similar.
- Enums for alternations.
- `nom` integration?
- Tests covering all of the regex syntaxes
- Unicode and performance feature flags
